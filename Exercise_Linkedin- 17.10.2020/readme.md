Exercise: create a news feed (e.g: like linkedin)

We will only focus on the column in the middle (the posts, e.g: https://i.insider.com/587ffc61ee14b62b008b8c91?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp)
Each post needs to have at least as a div containing:

- a profile pic of the person posting stuff (rounded pic)
- their name
- their job position
- a post title (use proper heading elements)
- some text

1. Create 4/5 posts of which 2/3 contain an img. At least 1 img must be missing, so provide a good alt description
2. Every odd post must have a light background
3. Every even post must have a dark background
4. Each post must have a "back-to-top" button
5. At least 1/2 posts must have links to a wiki page
